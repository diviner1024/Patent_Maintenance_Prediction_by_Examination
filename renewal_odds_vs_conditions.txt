This figure compares the patent renewal rate (at 4th, 8th, and 12th years after grant) given different features extracted from patent examination process. 

The left one compares if the patent had applied for Request for Continued Examination (RCE), which is often used after a Final Rejection is issued and by applying for this, the patent applicant can continue the examination process without having to start over and file a new application. This request costs $1,200 for the first time and $1,700 afterwards. More RCEs suggests the applicant is willing to pay more to have the opportunity to argue with the examination to keep their claims. The result confirms this point: patents with 1 RCE have 5% higher rate than baseline to get renewed (e.g. 72.8% vs. 69.3% at 8th year), patents with 2 or more RCEs have even higher chance to get renewed.

The center one investigates the effect of provisional application. The provisional application is usually filed to set up an earlier priority date for subsequent patent applications, like a placeholder, when the latter is still in preparation. This process also costs and suggests the applicants put more effort in the application process. The results show patent with provisional applications are more likely to receive renewal, and the effect increases with time.

The right one studies the effect from patent entity. The USPTO applies discount to small (50% off) and micro (75% off) entities for most fees to encourage innovations from small business. The results show an astonishing lower rate for small entities, yet the rate for micro entity is way above average.
